# 🎙️ Speech-to-Text Pad — Because Typing Is Overrated And we are in 2025 Come On

Welcome to **Speech-to-Text Pad**, a clean, animated, voice-powered note-taking tool built with pure  
**HTML + CSS + JavaScript** and the magical **Web Speech API**.  

Hit the big shiny mic button 🎤 → speak → watch your thoughts appear in real-time with  
**smart punctuation**, **auto-capitalization**, and a **smooth UI** that looks way more expensive than it is.

### ✨ What makes it awesome?
- 🎧 Real-time speech recognition  
- 🔤 Voice-controlled punctuation (say *comma*, *period*, *question mark*, *new line*, etc.)  
- 🧠 Auto-clean formatting + sentence capitalization  
- 📝 Save notes & send them back to the pad  
- 💫 Polished animations, glowing cards, and a futuristic mic pulse  
- 🔥 Zero backend — runs entirely in your browser  

### 🙃 Why this exists
Because sometimes typing feels illegal and your fingers need a day off.  
Let your voice do the work. Your browser will handle the grammar... mostly. 😅
